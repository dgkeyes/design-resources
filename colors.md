Borne out of what Lu describes as frustration with existing color-picking tools, their web app Viz Palette, uncovered recently by Flowing Data, lets you test your color palette for legibility in different formats, line weights, backgrounds, and font colors. It also shows you what your colors look like to users with different types of color blindness, like deuteranomaly and protanopia. If two colors are too similar, Viz Palette lets you knowâ€“and allows you to randomize the sample data to see it with fresh eyes." - from [Fast Company article about it](https://www.fastcompany.com/90168112/viz-palette-the-ultimate-tool-for-anyone-who-works-with-color)
