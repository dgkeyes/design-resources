# Shiny

Shiny is probably what most people think of in relation to interactivity within R. It's more complicated to learn than other packages and you also need to host any outputs made with Shiny somewhere that has Shiny Server installed, which can be limiting.

# Other R interactivity options

*   [ggiraph](https://davidgohel.github.io/ggiraph/index.html): Simple way to add tooltips to plots made with ggplot
*   [Plotly](https://plot.ly/r/): "Plotly's R graphing library makes interactive, publication-quality graphs online. Examples of how to make line plots, scatter plots, area charts, bar charts, error bars, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, subplots, multiple-axes, and 3D (WebGL based) charts."
*   [googleVis](https://github.com/mages/googleVis): "The googleVis package provides an interface between R and the Google's charts tools. It allows users to create web pages with interactive charts based on R data frames." 
*   [widgetframe](https://github.com/bhaskarvk/widgetframe): Allows you to put R output into htmlwidgets in iframes for embedding other places
*   [Trelliscope](https://hafen.github.io/trelliscopejs/index.html): "Trelliscope is a visualization approach based on the idea of “small multiples” or “Trellis Display”, where data are split into groups and a plot is made for each group, with the resulting plots arranged in a grid. This approach is very simple yet is considered to be “the best design solution for a wide range or problems in data presentation”. Trelliscope makes small multiple displays come alive by providing the ability to interactively sort and filter the plots based on summary statistics computed for each group."
*   [Crosstalk](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/using.html): "Crosstalk makes it easy to link multiple (Crosstalk-compatible) HTML widgets within an R Markdown page or Shiny app." You can do some basic filtering using Crosstalk without having to go the full Shiny route.
